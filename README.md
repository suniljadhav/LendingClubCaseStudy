### Problem Statement:
You work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. 

Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
1. If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
2. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.
----
### Goal:
1. Using EDA, identify risky loan applicants. 
   When a person applies for a loan, there are two types of decisions that could be taken by the company.
    1. Loan Accepted
        1. Fully paid
        2. Current loan running
        3. Loan defaulted / Charged-off
    2. Loan Rejected (Applicant data not in the dataset)
2. Understand the driving factors (driver variables) behind loan default i.e the variables which are strong indicators of default
